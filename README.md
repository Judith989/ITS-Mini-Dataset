# TraPedesVeh
This repository contains the TraPedesVeh mini dataset which is a collection of annotated images containing vehicles, traffic signs and pedestrians. It was first introduced in the paper titled "State-of-the-Art Object Detectors for Vehicle, Pedestrian, and Traffic Sign Detection for Smart Parking Systems", which was presented at the International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC2022), Jeju, South Korea.
